	<h1>E-Series tray/drawer loss of redundancy</h1>
	<p>Check the recoveryGURU to see which components and trays are reporting the loss of redundancy.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Controller / Controller Tray</li>
		<li>ESM / IOM (Environmental Services Module / Input Output Module) / Expansion Tray</li>
		<li>Drive Drawer (60-Bay Enclosure)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Investigate any components specified in the recoveryGURU to ensure those components are seated properly and powered on.</p>
	
	<p>Controllers and ESMs/IOMs can be unseated and reseated if needed to ensure proper seating and power.</p>

	<p>Investigate the backend cabling to ensure that all cables are securely connected and the ports display link lights.</p>
	<p>Cables connected to controllers and ESMs/IOMs can be unseated and reseated if needed.</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Be sure not to unseat or disconnect cables on the working side. Doing so will result in a complete loss of access to that tray and any tray below it in the chain.</p>

	<p>The difficulty in troubleshooting a loss of redundancy on drive trays ranges from simple to very complex and may require active knowledge of how to read and interpret the State Capture data located within a standard support bundle.</p>
